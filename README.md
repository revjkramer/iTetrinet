TetriNET Client Updated and Built For Apple Silicone
This is a rebuild and branch off of the original code from Xale.
The only thing I have done is remove GROWL notifications (as that is no longer a thing). 
I have also updated the components and compiled for Appple Silicone. I have set the compilation for macOS Monterey.
I also removed the pause button and used cocoa dark.
