TetriNET Client Updated and Built For Apple Silicone
This is a rebuild and branch off of the original code from Xale.
The only thing I have done is remove GROWL notifications (as that is no longer a thing). 
I have also updated the components and compiled for Appple Silicone. I have set the compilation for macOS Monterey.
I also removed the pause and forfeit buttons because I couldn't get them to work.
Everything else works. Please note there are some bugs. Maybe if somebody with a little more coding experience than I can iron it all out and make it right. As of right now this is the only modern client on macOS(arm64) that actually works.
